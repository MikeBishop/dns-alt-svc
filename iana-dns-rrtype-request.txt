DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER ALLOCATION TEMPLATE

When ready for formal consideration, this template is to be submitted
to IANA for processing by emailing the template to dns-rrtype-
applications@ietf.org.

A. Submission Date:  2020-06-18

B.1 Submission Type:  [ X ] New RRTYPE  [ ] Modification to RRTYPE
B.2 Kind of RR:  [ X ] Data RR  [ ] Meta-RR

C. Contact Information for submitter (will be publicly posted):
   Name: Erik Nygren                       Email Address: erik+ietf@nygren.org
   International telephone number:  +1 617 444 3938
   Other contact handles:

D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.
   Please keep this part at a high level to inform the Expert and
   reviewers about uses of the RRTYPE.  Most reviewers will be DNS
   experts that may have limited knowledge of your application space.

   The "SVCB" RR type facilitates the lookup of information needed to
   make connections for origin resources.  SVCB records allow an
   origin to be served from multiple network locations, each with
   associated parameters (such as transport protocol configuration and
   keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello).  They also enable
   aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME.  By
   providing more information to the client before it attempts to
   establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to
   both performance and privacy.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.
   This description can be provided in-line in the template, as an
   attachment, or with a publicly available URL.

   See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-00
   
F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
   and why are they unsatisfactory?

   (from I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-00 #appendix-A)

   The SRV record [RFC2782] can perform a similar function to the SVCB
   record, informing a client to look in a different location for a
   service.  However, there are several differences:
   o  SRV records are typically mandatory, whereas clients will always
      continue to function correctly without making use of SVCB RRs.
   o  SRV records cannot instruct the client to switch or upgrade
      protocols, whereas SVCB can signal such an upgrade (e.g. to
      HTTP/2).
   o  SRV records are not extensible, whereas SVCB RRs can be
      extended with new parameters, such as for
      TLS Encrypted Client Hello keys.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

   SVCB

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
   or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
   Parameters?  If so, please indicate which registry is to be used
   or created.  If a new subregistry is needed, specify the
   allocation policy for it and its initial contents.  Also include
   what the modification procedures will be.

   Yes, per I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-00#section-12:

   * Create a new "Service Binding (SVCB) Parameter Registry"
     with an initial population of entries.  This would
     be shared with the HTTPS RR type.

I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
   servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
   as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

   No.  While DNS servers and resolvers may perform performance
   optimizations described in the I-D, these are optional
   and do not preclude processing as an unknown RRTYPE.

J. Comments:

   The plan is to bring draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https to Working Group
   Last Call during Summer 2020.  A early code point allocation
   for the SVCB RRtype and HTTPS RRtype is requested to enable interop
   testing between multiple implementations that are in-progress.

D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.
   Please keep this part at a high level to inform the Expert and
   reviewers about uses of the RRTYPE.  Most reviewers will be DNS
   experts that may have limited knowledge of your application space.

   The "HTTPS" DNS RR type facilitates the lookup of information
   needed to make connections for origin resources, such as for HTTPS
   URLs.  HTTPS RRs allow an origin to be served from multiple network
   locations, each with associated parameters (such as transport
   protocol configuration and keys for encrypting the TLS
   ClientHello).  They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is
   not possible with CNAME.  By providing more information to the
   client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records
   offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy.
   For example, the presence of an HTTPS RR indicates that clients
   should upgrade insecure "http" URLs to secure "https" URLs prior
   to establishing a connection.
